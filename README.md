This project implements and compares three fundamental pathfinding algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A Search Algorithm*. Using the Pyamaze library, the project demonstrates how these algorithms navigate a maze efficiently.

Features:

Generates a maze using Pyamaze.
Implements BFS, DFS, and A* algorithms for pathfinding.
Compares execution efficiency and path quality.
Visualizes results with animations.
Logs runtime for performance analysis.

Installation: 

To run this project, install the required dependencies:

pip install numpy pyamaze

Algorithms Implemented

Breadth-First Search (BFS):

Explores all possible paths layer by layer.

Guarantees the shortest path.

Depth-First Search (DFS):

Explores paths deeply before backtracking.

Does not guarantee the shortest path.

A* Search Algorithm:

Uses a heuristic function to guide the search.

Efficient and optimal for pathfinding.

Performance Analysis:

The notebook records execution time and path length for each algorithm, displaying a comparative analysis of their efficiency.
